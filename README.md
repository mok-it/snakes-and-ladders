# Snakes and ladders

This is a tiny app for a camp activity. It is not a board game by itself, but it helps gamifying any existing activity. The main idea is the teams are assigned a piece on the board, and by solving excercises, they are given points to advance on the board. The first team to reach the end wins. 

Note: everything is saved in your browser's local storage, so you won't lose your progress if you refresh the page, but nobody else using the app in the same time will see the teams, pieces, etc. on your board.

You can use the most recent version of the app [here](https://snakes-and-ladders-mok.web.app/).
